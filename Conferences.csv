SANS ICS Security Summit,Orlando,2-9 March,https://www.sans.org/event/ics-security-summit-2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,"For over a decade the SANS ICS Security Summit has been a leading conference on bringing together researchers, industry professionals, and government audiences. The page above links to the various SANS ICS events but look for the one that says “ICS Security Summit” each year. It is usually held in March at Disney World in Orlando Florida. Its strong suit is the educational and training aspects not only because of the classes but also because of the strong industry focus."
